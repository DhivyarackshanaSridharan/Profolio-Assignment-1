            <p class="note">I choose this short clip from <em>Squid Game</em> as a symbolic reflection of my own journey. The challenges faced by the characters represent how students, including myself, often naviagate presuure, competition, and the need to make quick, thoughtful decisions. For me, it highlights the importance of resilience, teamwork, and staying focused on long-term goals despite obstacles.</p>
